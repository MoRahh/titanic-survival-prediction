# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains code and resources for predicting Titanic survival based on passenger data. The project is based on the [Kaggle Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). The goal is to build a predictive model that answers the question: "What sorts of people were more likely to survive?"
